# Hi there!
I'm Jared. I currently work as a Digital Consultant at Arup. Most of my work can't be shared publicly, but this is where I keep personal projects. You'll notice I have a problem where I impulse buy domains for my friends. Things might get weird. 


# My repos
## Arup Social Data
I lied! This is work I can share publicly!

I've been leading this pro-bono project at Arup to create an open database and code to help address the looming eviction crisis in the US. I'm pretty proud of this project and hope that it can help some people. 

You can read all about the code and data at the [repository](https://github.com/arup-group/social-data). You can also check out the data using our fun new [Streamlit app!](https://share.streamlit.io/arup-group/social-data/run.py)

## Deal or No Deal
I contend that Deal or No Deal is the greatest game show ever conceived by humanity. It's a fascinating window into what humans value and the how we experience the collective enterprise of humanity itself. But that's not what this repository is all about. 

I'm interested in how the Banker works, so I decided to try to reverse engineer the Banker's algorithm. You can follow along with this full saga through [some articles I wrote on Medium](https://towardsdatascience.com/i-figured-out-how-deal-or-no-deal-works-kind-of-875e63a8cef6), but this repository is where I've been storing all of that code. I've been using Streamlit to build interfaces to help me collect data, vizualize trends, and build and test machine learning models to replicate the Banker. 

## Teetum.com
This is a [joke website](https://teetum.com/blog) I made for my friend Tatum's birthday. It's a parody of her blog, laden with jokes that will make no sense and pictures that straddle the line of postability. I debuted this at her spooky-themed birthday party and it's one of the best gifts I've ever given.

 It's a pretty simple Angular app that I used to teach myself about deployment on AWS, https, and DNS management. I also designed this to work best on mobile but still be usable on a desktop. I also added a bunch of little easter eggs throughout and all of them will make no sense. 

## Bigballsannie.com
Ok yes, I know. The name. I think it would be better for both of us if you didn't ask. 

Otherwise, this is another joke website I made for my friend's birthday. You can visit this ridiculous site at [bigballsannie.com](https://bigballsannie.com/) (or .club, for some reason), but you'll have to answer a math problem to enter, because my friend loves math. This was designed _entirely_ for a mobile web user, so it will look a bit janky on a desktop. 

I took this project in a different artistic direction than the previous joke site I made. Due to my friend's obsession with Animal Crossing, I decided to turn this into a sort of playground with a Stonk Market game (based on Animal Crossing turnip-based Stalk Market), a bulletin board of embarassing pictures, and an endless math quiz.

## Interpolator
This is one of the very first projects I ever did. I made a really simple html and JavaScript interpolation calculator. This was a chance for me to learn about frontend web development and stumble way to deploying a real site. The domain has since expired, but the code is still here for me look back at with a mix of pride and embarrassment. 

## Coursera
These are from an AngularJS course I did a few years ago. Each is an assignment. Since AngularJS is now effectively dead, these aren't very useful.
